Assuming working directory is here, the script should reproduce Figure S60. Note that due to stochastic character of the algorithm, the resulting picture may sligthly differ, however, the general topology should be preserved. The labels in the Figure S60 were assigned by manual inspection of coordinates deposited in `../molecule_data/fig_s60_crd.csv`.
